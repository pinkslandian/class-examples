        <p> Okay, So I am one of those idiots who doesn't know their left from right and have to use their
        hands in the shape of an 'L' to figure it out.
         I'm sorta more book smart than practical smart? 
         Either way, I'm working on it. I can't drive not knowing my left from right. 
         Yikes that would be terrible. </p>
         
         <ul> What I don't like about the research I find in right handed people
        <li> Everytime I look up right handed people the results for left handed people appear </li>
        <li> There are not a lot of credible sources. </li>
        <li> Every website contains the. exact. same. thing...</li>
        </ul>
         
        <ol> Facts about right handed people
           <li> Majority of the people in the world are right handed people </li> 
           <li> 70 to 90 percent of people are right handed </li>
           <li> It is a myth that right handed people live longer </li>
        </ol>
